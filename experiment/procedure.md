#### Part-1: Acoustic-Phonetic Labeling (pre-labeled examples)

 Step1: Select an utterance/prelabeled of your choice from the list of examples provided.

 Step2: By repeatedly 'Zoom Slider' in and listening to different segments of the speech waveform identify regions of voiced/unvoiced/plosive/silence. Observe the time-varying nature of the waveform from one region to the other.

 Step3: Select the correct excitation type, manner of articulation (MoA) and place of articulation (PoA) for each of the phonemes listed in the table.

 Step4: Click on the phoneme symbol (first column of the table) to 'Zoom Slider' fit to the pre segmented label, and observe the signal characteristics.

 Step5: Write a brief note on the observations.


#### Part-2: Acoustic-Phonetic labeling without feedback

 Step1: Write down a sentence of your choice in one of the chosen languages and click on 'Done'button

 Step2: Record the sentence you chose in the previous step.

 Step3: Observe the signal characteristics of different phones in the sentence and choose the appropriate excitation type, MoA and PoA for each phoneme.

 Step4: Repeat the experiment by recording different sentences covering different categories of sound units.

## Observations

Every phoneme can be completely and uniquely described by using the acoustic-phonetic descriptors.

Time varying nature of the excitation source can be clearly observed from the speech waveform.

   a. Quasiperiodic waveform during voiced speech
   
   b. Random noise-like waveform during unvoiced speech
   
   c. Lack of any significant signal amplitude during silence or nonspeech region
   
   d. Low or negligible signal amplitude (closure region) followed by a burst during the production of plosive sounds.


Time varying nature of the vocal tract system can be observed from the change in waveform shape within each glottal cycle (pitch cycle) for different voiced sounds.
