### Procedure

 #### Part-1: Acoustic-Phonetic Labeling (pre-labeled examples)

 Step1: Select an utterance/prelabeled of your choice from the list of examples provided.

 Step2: By repeatedly 'Zoom Slider' in and listening to different segments of the speech waveform identify regions of voiced/unvoiced/plosive/silence. Observe the time-varying nature of the waveform from one region to the other.

 Step3: Select the correct excitation type, manner of articulation (MoA) and place of articulation (PoA) for each of the phonemes listed in the table.

 Step4: Click on the phoneme symbol (first column of the table) to 'Zoom Slider' fit to the pre segmented label, and observe the signal characteristics.

 Step5: Write a brief note on the observations.


#### Part-2: Acoustic-Phonetic labeling without feedback

 Step1: Write down a sentence of your choice in one of the chosen languages and click on 'Done'button

 Step2: Record the sentence you chose in the previous step.

 Step3: Observe the signal characteristics of different phones in the sentence and choose the appropriate excitation type, MoA and PoA for each phoneme.

 Step4: Repeat the experiment by recording different sentences covering different categories of sound units.
