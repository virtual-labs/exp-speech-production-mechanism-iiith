### Observations

Every phoneme can be completely and uniquely described by using the acoustic-phonetic descriptors.

Time varying nature of the excitation source can be clearly observed from the speech waveform.

   a. Quasiperiodic waveform during voiced speech
   
   b. Random noise-like waveform during unvoiced speech
   
   c. Lack of any significant signal amplitude during silence or nonspeech region
   
   d. Low or negligible signal amplitude (closure region) followed by a burst during the production of plosive sounds.


Time varying nature of the vocal tract system can be observed from the change in waveform shape within each glottal cycle (pitch cycle) for different voiced sounds.
